# hello-world
**Welcome to my github!**

I am new here to github and I am learning the coding ropes with Python3!
I am a self taught programmer built from the ground up and I am using all
available open-source opportunites that I can find to better myself in
becoming a fantastic developer. I currently use 3 different sources for
learning to make sure I always have a source to learn from when there
happens to be any downtime. My first choice was Automating the boring
stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. I wanted a book to first start off 
learning to get back into good habits of both reading and time managment.
I haven't read for knowledge or pleasure pretty much since my short time 
at college so getting back into is quite important to me. I am on chapter
7 now and just barely getting actual code put together. Shortly after 
starting this journey I realised my current lifestyle couldn't properly
help foster good habits just from reading and having to dedicate time 
frames to practice. So my next step was to find a solution to learn
well I was anywhere other then at home and had time to practice. This lead
me to an app called SoloLearn which had a nice interface and scored 
lessons to properly gauge a self taught persons ability. I use the app every
day to brush up on things I've already learned in the book to maintain
knowledge and keep building on the "basics". My last option was one that 
I had to ensure was in a space that could be both mobile and at home as well
as have some sort of credibility backing that I could show "Hey I did this,
I know this, and I can prove it on paper." After scavenging reddit for awhile
I found this website:https://www.py4e.com/lessons. This has byfar been the best
part for me. The in-depth site has an Autograder feature that can run and test
code, compare it to the answer, and then tell if you are right or wrong. I know
other places do this as well to help with problem solving but there is no 
"curriculum" that is adhered to. This course has text, slide-show, and video
options to be able to get the information each with varying degree of difficulty.
I am on chapter 14 of this right now and I am flying through it. This one has 
been the best experience so far due to I always feel like I'm getting better
as well as I can visually see it! My scores on tests are updated instantly and 
after going through courses and scoring high on the test given is a huge moral 
boost. I have also used a number of IDE's because almost every tutorial uses
some different IDE. I have used mostly PyCharm and Visual Studio to code and
little bit of MU Editor from the book. I am excited to keep moving forward and
learning these new things every single day.
